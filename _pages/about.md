I am Chuhao Yin, a micro-speaker engineer and programming enthusiast turned researcher in ultrasound and acoustics. Since July 2024, I serve as an Associate Professor at the [School of Integrated Circuits](https://ic.nuist.edu.cn/) of [Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology](https://nuist.edu.cn/) (NUIST).

I received my Ph.D. in acoustics from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) (NJU) in 2024, and currently hold a joint appointment between NUIST's School of Integrated Circuits and the Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology Group at Nanjing University. 

My research interests include **ultrasound imaging**, **thermal strain imaging**, **elastography**, **motion estimation**, **vascular ultrasound**, **signal processing** and **machine learning**.

I am always looking forward to interacting and collaborating with peers who share the similar research interests, contact me via <chyin@nuist.edu.cn> or [WeChat](...\images\wechat.jpg) if you are interested. In my free time, you can find me on Steam or at the NJU Gym.
